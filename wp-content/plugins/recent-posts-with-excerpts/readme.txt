A widget that lists your most recent posts with optional excerpts.   

== Description ==

A widget that lists your most recent posts with excerpts, optionally limited to a category. The number of posts and excerpts is configurable; for example, you could show the titles of five posts but include the excerpt for only the two most recent. Supports <a href="http://robsnotebook.com/the-excerpt-reloaded/">the_excerpt Reloaded</a> and <a href="http://sparepencil.com/code/advanced-excerpt/">Advanced Excerpt</a> for excerpts with HTML formatting.

New! Supports displaying post thumbnails along with excerpts. Widget options let you place the thumbnails above the title, in between the title and the excerpt, or below the excerpt.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` 
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Go to Appearance &rarr; Widgets to add widgets to your sidebar in widget-ready themes.

== FAQ ==

To style your excerpts, add a declaration for `.recent_with_excerpt li blockquote` to your theme's stylesheet.

To add a link to the bottom of the widget's output, below the list, use the `recent_posts_with_excerpts_end` action. Example:

`
add_action( 'recent_posts_with_excerpts_end', 'my_recent_posts_more' );
function my_recent_posts_more() {
	echo '<a class="readmore" href="/news/archive">More</a>';
}
`

To add something above the list, use the `recent_posts_with_excerpts_begin` action instead.
