A NOT official fork of Jetpack plugin containing only Stats and WP.me Shortlinks modules. All other modules removed (files and code).

== Description ==

**IMPORTANT: This plugin IS NOT official Jetpack by WordPress.com - If you're looking for the official plugin go to [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/)**


**Jetpack Lite is a NOT official fork** of [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/). Original Jetpack seems to me like a "bloated" plugin, because all modules are activated by default (in previous versions) and even with the choice of deactivating modules (one by one), installing
this plugin in dozens of WordPress installations and deactivate modules per each of them can be a nightmare.

So I made **this fork that only contains Stats and WP.me Shortlinks modules**. The same features of [WordPress.com Stats](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/) plugin that sadly have been discontinued replaced by Jetpack by WordPress.com

All other modules have been removed, also access to site stats was moved to dashboard menu and Jetpack Lite settings moved under WordPress settings menu. And some cometic changes to make more clear that this's not the official Jetpack. **No other modifications have been done**.

**NOTE: This plugin IS NOT supported by original Jetpack by WordPress.com support staff.**
**This is ONLY a fork and NOT the official plugin** and, although is not probable, may contain bugs not present in the original plugin, **use it at your own risk!**

And if you don't feel confortable using it or need a great support, it's better to install original and official from here: [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/).

Features include:

* Simple, concise stats with no additional load on your server.  Previously provided by [WordPress.com Stats](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/).
* The [WP.me URL shortener](http://wp.me/sf2B5-shorten).
*  and *nothing* more to come!

**REMEMBER: This plugin IS NOT official Jetpack by WordPress.com - If you're looking for the official plugin go to [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/)**

== Installation ==

1. If you have Jetpack by WordPress.com previously installed and activated, first deactivate it (and delete it if you want, you'll not need it anymore).
2. Install Jetpack Lite either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server
3. After activating Jetpack Lite, you will be asked to connect to WordPress.com to enable the Jetpack features.
4. Click the connect button and log in to a WordPress.com account to authorize the Jetpack connection.
5. If you don't yet have a WordPress.com account, you can quickly create one after clicking the connect button.
6. That's it.  You're ready to go!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin an official release from Automattic or WordPress.com? =

NO. Jepack Lite **IS NOT an official** plugin by Automattic or WordPress.com, it's only a fork made by an user and shared for people who wants to use WP stats and WP.me shortener without nothing more.

If you're looking for the official plugin go to [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/)

= I already have a WordPress account, but it's not working, what's going on? =

Jetpack Lite requires a connection to [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) to enable all features. This is a different account than the one you use to log into your self-hosted WordPress. If you can log into http://wordpress.com, then you already have a WordPress.com account. If you can't, then you can easily create one as part of the installation of Jetpack Lite.

= How do I view my stats? =

Once you've installed Jetpack Lite, your stats will be available via the "Site Stats" menu which appears under the dashboard menu. And you can access to Jetpack settings under settings menu.

= What update policy will this plugin follow? =

I'll only update this plugin when Stats or WP.me shortlinks can be affected by a new released of the official Jetpack by WordPress.com

Remember, if you don't feel confortable using this unofficial fork or need a great support, it's better to install the official [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/).
