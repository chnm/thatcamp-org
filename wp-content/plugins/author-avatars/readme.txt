Display lists of user avatars using widgets or shortcodes.

== Description ==

This plugin makes it easy to *display lists of user avatars* on your (multiuser) blog. It also allows to *insert single avatars* for blog users or any email address into a post or page. (Great for displaying an image of someone you're talking about.)

Avatar lists can be inserted into your sidebar by adding a widget or into posts/pages by using a [shortcode](http://authoravatars.wordpress.com/documentation/authoravatars-shortcode/). The plugin comes with a tinymce editor plugin which makes inserting shortcodes very easy.

Please help with the plugin Translations at https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/author-avatars.

Both shortcode and widget can be configured to...

*   Show a custom title (widget only)
*   Only show specific user groups and/or hide certain users
*   Limit the number of users shown
*   Change the sort order of users or show in random order
*   Adjust the size of user avatars
*   Optionally show a user's name or biography
*   Show users from the current blog, all blogs or a selection of blogs (on WPMU/Multisite)
*   Group users by their blog (when showing from multiple blogs), and show the blog name above each grouping (experimental feature).
*	Supports users from co-authors, Ultimate Member, BBpress and BudyPress

* the shortcode can page the avatars for large sets add a page_size to the shortcode e.g. "page_size=30"

The plugin makes use of built in wordpress (core) functions to retrieve user information and get avatars.

The Plug-in can show users from bb-press, Budy-press (xprofile) and Co-Author Plus Plug-in

Single user avatars can be inserted using the [show_avatar shortcode](http://authoravatars.wordpress.com/documentation/show_avatar-shortcode/) and configured to...

*   Adjust the size of the user avatar.
*   Align the avatar left, centered or right.

Please report bugs and provide feedback in the [wordpress support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/author-avatars?forum_id=10#postform).

**Plugin support:** As of April 2011, Ben is stepping down as maintainer and handing over ownership to Paul Bearne, who will provide support and drive the development of new features.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `author-avatars` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enable and configure the widget as usual on the Design / Widgets page.

[Look at this page](https://authoravatars.wordpress.com/documentation/authoravatars-shortcode/) to find out how to use the [authoravatars] shortcode.

You can find information for developers [on this page](http://authoravatars.wordpress.com/documentation/developers-guide/).

== Upgrade Notice ==

<strong>Breaking change in 1.8.0 </strong> in CSS *.multiwidget_author_avatars* is now *.widget_author_avatars*. This is caused by a library change  in-order to support the jetpack visibility option.<br />
If you have added CSS to your theme you may have to update it for this upgrade (do a find and replace).

== Screenshots ==

1. Very simple set up of the widget on an empty blog.
2. The Widget configuration panel.
3. Examples of what the <code>[authoravatars]</code> shortcode can do.
4. Shortcode helper available from the WYSIWYG editor on the edit post page.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Shortcode, huh? =

A shortcode is a tag like <code>[authoravatars]</code> which you can insert into a page or post to display a list of users on that post/page. You can read more about shortcodes in general in the wordpress codex, for example [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode) or [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API).

= How do I use the author avatar shortcode? =

As of version 0.6 the plugin comes with a tinymce plugin which makes it very easy to insert shortcode(s).

If you'd like to do it manually it's still simple: just add <code>[authoravatars]</code> into your post and hit save! There's a large number of [parameters](http://authoravatars.wordpress.com/documentation/authoravatars-shortcode/) available.

The plugin comes with two shortcodes: <code>[authoravatars]</code> for lists of avatars and <code>[show_avatar]</code> for single avatars.

= I can't get my widget to show users from multiple blogs! =

Make sure you have enabled the "blog filter" in Site Admin / Author Avatars for the blog on which you are trying to use this feature on. By default this is only enabled for the root blog (blog id = 1).

And you are running [Wordpress MU](http://mu.wordpress.org/) (or respectively WordPress 3 in multi-site mode), right?

= Can I upload custom pictures for users? =

No, the Author Avatars List plugin only provides ways of <strong>displaying</strong> user avatars.

The plugin uses the Wordpress Core Template function <code>get_avatar()</code> to retrieve the actual avatar images. In order to display custom images you need to look for plugins which use/override WordPress' avatar features and provide respective upload features...

Have a look at the [User Photo](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-photo/) Plugin (turn on option "Override Avatar with User Photo") or the [Add Local Avatar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-local-avatar/) Plugin.

= I get a "404 Page not found" error when I click on the avatar of a user! =

This can happens when you've choosen to link users to their "author page" and the user has not written any posts on a blog. There are two things that you should do in this situation:

1. To prevent the 404 page from showing up install the [Show authors without posts](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/show-authors-without-posts/) Plugin. This forces WordPress to always show the user page if the user exists.

2. If not already there add a custom user/author template to your theme. Otherwise if a user has no posts their user page is going to be quite empty by default...
You can find a [tutorial](http://codex.wordpress.org/Author_Templates) on Author Templates as well as a [Sample Template File](http://codex.wordpress.org/Author_Templates#Sample_Template_File) in the WordPress Codex.

= Can I use html in user biographies? =

Wordpress Core unforunately strips all html from the user biography field when entered. Install the plugin [Weasel's HTML Bios](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/weasels-html-bios/) if you want to use html...

= How can I change the styling of the avatar lists? =

The styling of the widget is controlled by the styles defined in [css/widgets.css](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/author-avatars/trunk/css/widget.css), avatars on posts/pages (using the shortcode) are styled by code in [css/shortcode.css](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/author-avatars/trunk/css/shortcode.css).

You can override the styles in that file by copying a style block to your theme's `style.css` and adjusting respectively. For example add the following to remove the padding from avatars displayed in a widget:

`html .widget_author_avatars .author-list .user {
  padding: 0;
}`
