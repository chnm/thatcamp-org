YOP Poll plugin allows you to easily integrate a survey in your blog post/page and to manage the polls from within your WordPress dashboard but if offers so much more than other similar products.  Simply put, it doesn't lose sight of your needs and ensures that no detail is left unaccounted for.

To name just a few improvements, you can create polls to include both single or multiple answers, work with a wide variety of options and settings to decide how you wish to sort your poll information, how to manage the results, what details to display and what to keep private, whether you want to view the total votes or the total voters, to set vote permissions or block voters etc.

Scheduling your polls is no longer a problem. YOP Poll can simultaneously run multiple polls (no limit included) or you can schedule your polls to start one after another. Also, keeping track of your polls is easy, you have various sorting functions and you can access older versions at any time.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

This plugin was especially designed for flexibility and it is very easy to use. We don't expect you to encounter serious issues, but we included a list with some logical questions that you may find useful.

This is it. Check your page or post now.

= Do you have some predefined shortcodes that I can use? =

Yes

Latest Poll id = -2:           [yop_poll id="-2"]
Random Poll id = -3:           [yop_poll id="-3"]

= Can I have more than one poll active? =

Yes, you can run multiple polls at the same time or you can schedule them to begin one after another using the "Select start/end date" option.
