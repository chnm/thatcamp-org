These problems can usually be remedied by removing the wrapper tags which surround the menu in your theme. For example, most themes will have some HTML such as <code><div id=\"nav\"><?php wp_list_pages(); ?></div></code> which contains the existing themes menu. By placing the <code>pixopoint_menu()</code> function between those DIV tags, the menu will often interact with that DIV tag.
