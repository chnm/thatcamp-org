Requires at least: 3.2.1
Tested up to: 3.5.2
Stable tag: 0.8

Dynamic menus: This plugin automatically replaces selected Category / Post Tag / Custom Taxonomy links in a Custom Menu by a list of their posts/pages.

== Description ==

The custom menu only allows adding a link that leads to a list of posts and pages belonging to a taxonomy (category, tag or custom). I wanted to insert the posts and pages <b>themselves</b> into the menu, so I wrote this plug-in. If you want to list the posts and pages belonging to a certain taxonomy in the menu and if you want Wordpress to do this automatically for you, then I hope you will find this plugin useful.

<strong>Now also works for custom post taxonomies and custom post types!</strong>

= Using it =
Enable the plugin and go to Appearance > Menus. Create your Custom Menu. Add a taxonomy (category/tag/custom) to the menu. Next, you can choose if you would like to replace the original link (to a page that lists the items) by the posts and pages themselves.

For each Category or Post Tag item in the menu, you now have the following extra configuration options: 

* replace the link by a list of posts in the menu y/n; 
* specify the (maximum) number of posts you want to show for this item (-1 = all);
* their ordering (ascending/descending by none, ID, author, title, date, modified, parent, rand or comment_count); 
* keep or remove the original menu item (always / only if there are no posts / never);
* specify the title for the menu items. For this you can use %post_title, %post_author and other wildcards, see 'Other Notes > Wildcards'.

= Details =
This plugin uses the wp_nav_menu_objects filter hook to remove and replace category items in the menu by the posts in that category. It extends Walker_Nav_Menu_Edit to add input fields to Appearance > Menus and adds some CSS to style this properly.

== Wildcards ==

You can control the title of the menu items generated by the plug-in with the following wildcards:

* %post_title
* %post_author
* %post_feat_image (url only)
* %post_excerpt
* %post_url
* %post_date for the unformatted post date: 2012-11-10 18:14:23
* %post_date() for a formatted post date with the following default formatting: November 10th, 2012
* %post_date(&lt;your formatting here&gt;) for custom date formatting. Example: %post_date(l jS \of F Y, h:i:s A). See <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time">http://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time</a> for formatting options.
* %post_date_gmt
* %post_date_gmt()
* %post_date_gmt(&lt;your formatting here&gt;)
* %post_status
* %post_modified
* %post_modified()
* %post_modified(&lt;your formatting here&gt;)
* %post_modified_gmt
* %post_modified_gmt()
* %post_modified_gmt(&lt;your formatting here&gt;)
* %post_comment_count
* wildcards for custom fields, like %post_my_field, where 'my field' or 'my_field' is a custom field

== Tips and tricks ==

= Partial links =
Wordpress places a link around the title you create. For example, if you set the following title:

<strong>%post_title by %post_author</strong>

then Wordpress creates, for example:

&lt;a href="link_to_post1"&gt;<strong>Chocolate pie by Anna</strong>&lt;/a&gt;<br />
which results in<br />
<a href="link_to_post1">Chocolate pie by Anna</a><br />

Some things you can do:

<ul>
<li>Set title: <strong>%post_title&lt;/a&gt; by %post_author</strong><br />
<br />
Then Wordpress creates:<br />
<br />
&lt;a href="link_to_post1"&gt;<strong>Chocolate pie&lt;/a&gt; by Anna</strong>&lt;/a&gt;<br />
which results in<br />
<a href="link_to_post1">Chocolate pie</a> by Anna</a><br />
<br />
(Yes, there's an extra closing &lt;/a&gt; but that doesn't really matter.)
</li>
<li>
Set title: <strong>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mysite.com/something/"&gt;%post_title by %post_author</strong><br />
<br />
Then Wordpress creates:<br />
&lt;a href="link_to_post1"&gt;<strong>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mysite.com/something/"&gt;Chocolate pie by Anna</strong>&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="link_to_post2"&gt;<strong>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mysite.com/something/"&gt;Strawberry muffins by Susan</strong>&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
which results in <br />
<a href="link_to_post1"><strong></a><a href="http://www.mysite.com/something/">Chocolate pie by Anna</strong></a><br />
<a href="link_to_post2"><strong></a><a href="http://www.mysite.com/something/">Strawberry muffins by Susan</strong></a><br />
<br />
Note that <strong>all</strong> post links will point to the same URL.
</li>
<li>
Set title: <strong>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="%post_url#myhashtag"&gt;%post_title by %post_author</strong><br />
<br />
Then Wordpress creates:<br />
&lt;a href="link_to_post1"&gt;<strong>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="link_to_post1#myhashtag"&gt;Chocolate pie by Anna</strong>&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="link_to_post2"&gt;<strong>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="link_to_post2#myhashtag"&gt;Strawberry muffins by Susan</strong>&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
which results in <br />
<a href="link_to_post1"><strong></a><a href="link_to_post1#myhashtag">Chocolate pie by Anna</strong></a><br />
<a href="link_to_post2"><strong></a><a href="link_to_post2#myhashtag">Strawberry muffins by Susan</strong></a><br />
<br />
You can use this to have menu item links skip to a certain paragraph if you're using anchors in your HTML.
</li>
</ul>

You can freely use HTML in the menu items.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can't see it working in any way =

Problem: "I can't see what effect it has had. Nothing has changed (not that I can see) in the Appearance > Menu page. Just like before." 

Possible causes:
<ul>
<li>Issue 14527 (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14527) is the cause. When adding a menu item but <i>before</i> saving it, you will indeed see none of the promised checkboxes. So be sure to <b>save your menu</b> after you add a Category/Tag to your menu. <i>Then</i> you'll see the added functionality.

The reason is because the hook that is used to extend the functionality is not being applied until you've saved the item. A patch was approved for Wordpress 3.4, so upgrade your Wordpress installation. :)</li>
<li>You're already using another plugin that uses the wp_nav_menu_edit hook and has a higher priority than mine. This is by design: My plugin is not critical and therefore I don't claim a high priority on the hooks. Plugins/Themes that indicate to be more important will be given priority.</li>
<li>You're using a theme that somehow doesn't support editing the menu. Try using the default Wordpress theme to see if your problem persists. I can't offer much support if the theme is the problem, because this is my first and only plugin and I wouldn't know where to begin to solve theme problems..</li>
</ul>
