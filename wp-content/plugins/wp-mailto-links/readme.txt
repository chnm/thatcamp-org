== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =
The plugin combines the best email protection methods (CSS and JavaScript techniques). All of them are explained in [this article](https://ironikus.com/docs/knowledge-base/what-will-be-protected/).

A webpage contains code on the backside. In the code all email addresses will be obfuscated, to hide them from spambots. Only when people see the page and click on the mailto link, the encoded email address will be translated to a normal email address.

= What's the best way to protect my email address(es) on my site? =
Off course by activating this plugin :) on your site. But even still it's not recommended to use email addresses directly in your posts or in your theme templates.
It would be better to use the shortcode `[wpml_mailto]` and template tag `wpml_mailto()`, because when the plugin isn't active anymore, the email addresses would not be shown on your site.

= How can I exclude pages? =
You can exclude pages within our settings page. Simply activate the button for advanced settings and you will see an input field. 
In there, simply separate the page/post ids with a comma and save. 

Here is an example: 12,455,19

= Shortcode does not work in widgets. How can I make it work? =
By default shortcodes are not applied to (text) widgets. To support that you can add it to the text widget filter ([for more](http://www.wprecipes.com/how-to-add-shortcodes-in-sidebar-widgets)).
If you are not a coder, then just activate [this plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shortcodes-in-sidebar-widgets/), which does the same thing.

Do you have a problem or found a bug, please [report it](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-mailto-links#postform).

== Documentation ==

The plugin works out-of-the-box to protect your email addresses. All settings are default set to protect your email addresses automatically with the best method available.
If you want to manually create protected mailto links, just use the shortcode (`[wpml_mailto]`) within your posts or use the template tags (`wpml_mailto()` or `wpml_filter()`) in your theme files.

= Shortcode `[wpml_mailto email="..."]...[/wpml_mailto]` =
Create a protected mailto link in your posts:
`[wpml_mailto email="info@myemail.com"]My Email[/wpml_mailto]`

It's also possible to add attributes to the mailto link, like a target:
`[wpml_mailto email="info@myemail.com" target="_blank"]My Email[/wpml_mailto]`

= Shortcode `[wpmt_protect]...[/wpmt_protect]` =
Protect content using our plugin that is not encodedby default (E.g. some ajax loaded values):
`[wpmt_protect]YOUR CONTENT YOU WANT TO CHECK FOR EMAILS[/wpmt_protect]`

It's also possible to customize the encoding type using "protect_using". Possible values: char_encode, strong_method, without_javascript, with_javascript:
`[wpmt_protect protect_using="..."]YOUR CONTENT YOU WANT TO CHECK FOR EMAILS[/wpmt_protect]`

= Template tag `wpml_mailto( $email [, $display] [, $attrs] )` =
Create a protected mailto link in your template like:
`<?php
    if (function_exists('wpml_mailto')) {
        echo wpml_mailto('info@somedomain.com', 'Mail Me');
    }
?>`

= Template tag `wpml_filter( $content )` =
Filter given content to protect mailto links, shortcodes and plain emails (according to the settings in admin):
`<?php
    if (function_exists('wpml_filter')) {
        echo wpml_filter('Filter some content to protect an emailaddress like info@somedomein.com.');
    }
?>`
