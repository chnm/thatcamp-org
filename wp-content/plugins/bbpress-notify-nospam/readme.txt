== Description ==
This is a modification of the original bbPress-Notify plugin, after several failed attempts to contact the author requesting that he add the no-spam code to it. I don't like spam. Do you?

This plugin integrates into bbPress and sends a notification via e-mail when new topics or replies are posted. It is fully configurable in the bbPress settings.

= Settings include =

 * Override bbPress' core subscription messages with your own; 
 * Set Notification recipient roles for new topics;
 * Set Notification recipient roles for new replies; 
 * Set Notification e-mail's subject and body for both new topics and replies;
 * Send Background Notifications (to avoid delays in loading pages for large user databases);
 * Extensible through almost 40 handy actions and filters;

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire plugin folder via FTP to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the <strong>Settings -> Forums</strong> and select which roles should get notifications. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why am I not receiving notifications of a topic/reply that I created? =
 * As of version 1.9.4, topic/reply authors no longer get notified of their own posts by default.
 * Version 1.12 and up have settings to decide whether authors get notified or not.

= Where are the settings? =
 * All settings are under Admin -> Settings -> Forums -> Email Notifications

= Can a user turn off notifications? =
 * Originally, this plugin was developed to alert Administrators of new topics and replies. After a few iterations, users requested the ability to send
messages to other roles, which then could be characterized as spam. To allow your users to opt-out from receiving notifications, please consider purchasing 
the [Opt-out Add-on](http://usestrict.net/product/bbpress-notify-no-spam-opt-out-add-on/).
 * As of version 1.12, you can use this plugin with bbPress Forum/Topic subscribers, instead of- or in addition to roles. Just turn on the Override option for Forums or Topics.

= Does this plugin integrate with BuddyPress Groups? =
 * Out of the box, no. However, you can get BuddyPress Group notification functionality using our premium [bbpnns/BuddyPress Bridge plugin](http://usestrict.net/product/bbpress-notify-no-spam-buddypress-bridge/).
